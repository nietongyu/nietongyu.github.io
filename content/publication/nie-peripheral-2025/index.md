To the best of my knowledge, peripheral teleportation is the first software cybersickness mitigation technique that significantly outperforms a black field-of-view restrictor, the industry standard mitigation technique. You can download a demo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iwBvl4pfqE5b08RlhBxlkZLnUbSMVTQ0/view?usp=sharing) (compatible with SteamVR and Quest Link, only tested on a Meta Quest 2). The source code and a demo scene of the peripheral teleportation is on [GitHub](https://github.com/nietongyu/PeripheralTeleportation/tree/main)
